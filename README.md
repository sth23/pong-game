Next steps:
 - Adjust paddle behavior for angle that ball returns at (random option?)
 - Sound effects
 - Gradually increasing ball speed?
 - Keep track of lives and/or score
 - AI paddle control?
 - Some kind of random barrier in middle of screen, like a net
 - Option to pause/start game on particular keystroke
 - Split paddle controls for player1 and player2
